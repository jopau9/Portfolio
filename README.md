## Project Analysis

### User Profile

This site targets professionals in technology and engineering, including recruiters and potential employers. As a third-year Computer Engineering student, my objective is to use this site as a resume and portfolio to present my technical and professional competencies. By focusing on simplicity and directness, the site lets visitors understand my academic background, technical skills, and aspirations efficiently. My website also links to social media profiles on LinkedIn, GitHub, and Twitter, encouraging professional networking and engagement.

**Website Goals**:
1. Professional and sleek design that conveys my background.
2. Clear navigation, allowing users to find relevant information easily.
3. Direct access to contact and networking links to foster connections.

### Information Architecture

The website is structured into four main sections:

1. **Header**: Fixed at the top, providing links to the main sections and quick navigation.
2. **Landing Section**: A brief introduction, including my name, title, and an animated arrow inviting users to explore more.
3. **Skills and Curriculum**: This central section is organized into education, technical skills, and professional competencies, displayed with icons and brief descriptions for easy scanning. The CV download button provides an option for more details.
4. **Footer**: Social media icons link directly to my profiles with hover effects to increase engagement.

This layout ensures smooth navigation, allowing viewers to explore each section intuitively.

### Visual Design

For the site’s aesthetic, I chose a modern, dark color scheme that feels sleek and professional, with white and gray text for contrast. The background features a radial gradient from dark gray to black, which adds depth and emphasizes the foreground content. The typography uses **PolySans Neutral Wide** for headings, giving a bold, contemporary look, and **Roboto** for body text, ensuring readability.

The interactive elements—like hover animations on buttons and rotating social media icons—add subtle dynamism without being distracting. Icons in the Skills section visually represent programming languages and tools, making it easier for viewers to identify my proficiencies at a glance. The layout is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes, which ensures accessibility on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Design Proposal in Figma

The site’s design was prototyped in Figma, outlining the layout, color scheme, typography, and overall aesthetic. This Figma prototype provided a clear visual reference, streamlining the development process.

## Project Implementation

The site was coded with HTML and CSS, with JavaScript used to dynamically load the header and footer, ensuring consistency across pages and ease of updates. The main layout relies on CSS Flexbox and Grid, which allowed for flexible, responsive positioning of elements. Each file is structured with comments to improve readability and maintainability.

### Key Code Features

- **Grid Layout**: Used in the Skills section to organize technical icons clearly.
- **Hover Effects**: Applied to buttons and social media icons to enhance interactivity.
- **Download Button**: The CV button includes a smooth hover effect to draw attention.
